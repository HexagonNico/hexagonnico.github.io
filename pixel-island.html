						<b>Pixel Island</b> was the first Unity game I released.
						It is a sandbox game with no real challenge or objective where the player can freely build
						a village on an island by placing simple scenery objects.
					</p>
					<p>
						I created this game as a solo developer. My intention was to create a prototype to learn how
						to use Unity, but since it was received very positively I decided to finish it.
						I was responsible for all the programming, structuring of the project, writing its systems, and for part of the art.
						The rest of the art comes from a free-to-use asset, the soundtrack is entirely composed of royalty-free music.
					</p>
					<p>
						While working on this project I learned how to use the Unity editor and how to make the best of its features.
						It has helped me with all my following projects, where I mastered some of the notions I acquired when making Pixel Island.

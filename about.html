				Hi, my name is <b>Nico</b>, and I'm a self-taught game developer with a passion for indie games.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm currently studying Computer Science at the university of Bolzano, <b>Italy</b>, and making games in my free time.
				Learning game design made me notice how much thought goes into making a game, how objects and lights are strategically
				placed in the environment, how important is the structure of a level, and how many iterations it takes to create a flowing gameplay.
				In all the games I play I notice details that go unnoticed to most people, I learn from them and I incorporate them in my games,
				trying to improve myself every time, <b>always learning</b> new things.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since I value privacy, some personal information, for instance, my full name and my age, was omitted from this public website.
				If you desire to know more about me, feel free to get in touch. Below are all my contacts.

				Interests
			</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about gaming, especially about indie games.
				I have a particular liking for the Metroidvania genre and for action-adventure games.
				Some of my favorites are Hollow Knight, Ori, Evoland, Starbound, The Legend of Zelda, Ratchet and Clank.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy listening to EDM music and to video games soundtrack, as it helps me to focus while studying or while working.
				Some of my favorite artists are TheFatRat and Christopher Larkin.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have also maintained a Youtube channel where I documented almost every single project of my career as a game developer,
				from the first learning projects to the latests releases and game jams.
				I keep my videos as a journal of all the projects I worked on in the past.
				A link to the channel is in the contacts above.

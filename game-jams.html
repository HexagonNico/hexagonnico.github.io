				The following projects are games I created for Game Jams,
				game design marathons were developers have to created a game that fits a given theme in a short span of time.
				Since when I started participating in game jams, my abilities as a designer have greatly improved, before then I was just a programmer.
				The improvement can clearly be seen by looking at the projects below in a chronological order.

					<h3>Mythic Pieces</h3>
					<p>
						Mythic Pieces was created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/curdle-jam-21">Curdle Jam 21</a>,
						a non-ranked jam with the theme "fitting in".
						I had the idea of a puzzle game where the player must fit together different pieces of the map
						in order to reach the end of the level.
					</p>
					<p>
						This game was also my first Godot Engine release.
						Learning how to use the engine was my primary scope for this project.
					</p>
					<p>
						Release date: 8th January 2022

					<h3>Doors of Fate</h3>
					<p>
						Doors of fate was created for <a href="">a jam about time</a>, the theme was
						"Time is never on our side, but what if it was? What if we could control time?",
						with the optional theme "escaping fate".
						The way the theme was presented made me think of a psychological-horror game
						where the player must solve puzzles by literally manipulating their system's clock.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game was well received and was ranked 32nd out of 104 entries.
						The entry received the most points for technicality and creativity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Release date: 12th July 2021

					<h3>Unluckiest Ruins</h3>
					<p>
						Unluckiest Ruins was created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/low-stakes-high-rolling-2">Low Stakes High-Rolling 2</a> jam, where the theme was "falling apart".
						My entry is a platform game where all platforms collapse beneath the player's feet,
						resulting in a fast gameplay where the player must think and react quickly if they want to reach the end of the level.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game was ranked 2nd out of 4 entries.
						It received the most point for entertainment and implementation of the theme.

						Release date: 26th June 2021

					<h3>Tower of Time</h3>
					<p>
						Tower of Time was created for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-community-jam">GameDev.tv Community Jam</a>, with the theme "time".
						The game I submitted is a tower defense game where time is both the currency spent to create defences and the player's health.
						I created this game before I knew how to use any game engine, so I built one from scratch for it using LWJGL.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not only this game was my first entry to a game jam, it was also the first game I publicly released.
						It was ranked 182nd out of 227 entries.
					</p>
					<p>
						Release date: 29th May 2020

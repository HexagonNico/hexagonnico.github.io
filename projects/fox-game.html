					<p>
						This game demo was my first attempt at making a Metroidvania-adventure game.
						I worked on the game entirely by myself, I was responsible for all of the programming and all of the designing.
						A lot of the art used comes from free game assets, which are all listed in a file inside the game's folder.
					</p>
					<p>
						During this project I learned a lot about Unity 2D, its physics and animations systems.
						I learned how to design responsive controls, how to design levels and how to design UI.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first early builds of the game were well received on itch.io.
						The development of the game has continued since then, but it is currently on hold.
